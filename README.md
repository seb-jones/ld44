# Faustian Sands
Entry for Ludum Dare 44. Written in C, using SDL2. Developed on Arch Linux using Vim. Compiled on Windows with Visual Studio 2017.

## About
When I first saw the theme, I spent some time thinking and then wrote the following:

> 'Life' is not just our physical body or our conscious mind - it is everything we interactive with too. Even the stars in the sky are a part of our life.
>
> Would you give one of these things for another?
>
> How much would you give up?

This was the interpretation of the theme that I had in mind going into the compo, and hopefully this idea is reflected in the game.

## Installation

### Windows
Simply download one of the builds, extract the zip file, and run the executable.

### Linux
Clone this repo into a location of your choice.

Install the SDL2 dev package from your system's package manager, or compile it yourself.

`cd` into the cloned directory and run `make`.

Run `./a.out` to play.

## Usage
When given options, use the `Number Keys` to choose. Otherwise, use the `Enter Key` to proceed.

`F11` toggles fullscreen mode.
